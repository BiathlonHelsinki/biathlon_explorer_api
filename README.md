# biathlon_explorer_api
This is a back-end in Express that serves JSON to a Vue.js front-end.

The purpose of this is to show actual Biathlon transaction on the blockchain, and pull in related content from the local database.

This also is catching the repeated blockchain transactions that are going through, so it's a handy tool for now.
